Game Overview: Rust Strike
Rust Strike is a simple, top-down multiplayer shooting game with team-based gameplay. Players can host or join rooms and engage in combat with smooth movement and collision mechanics. Maps are procedurally generated with team spawn points and a central objective area. The game features a clean, minimalist design focused on tactical gameplay rather than complex graphics or sound.

Current Implementation Status:
✓ Basic Multiplayer Setup
- Firebase Realtime Database integration
- Room hosting and joining system
- Proper player synchronization (20 updates per second)
- Team-based player assignment (auto-balancing)
- Clean disconnection handling (both tab close and exit button)

✓ Basic Movement System
- Smooth, non-grid-based movement
- Proper collision detection with walls
- Player position synchronization across clients

✓ Map System
- Procedurally generated maps with varied room sizes and hallways
- Team-based spawn points (red and blue)
- Central objective area
- Minimum room count to ensure interesting layouts
- Wall collision detection

Next Development Phases:

1. Game Rounds System

- Score tracking
- Round timer implementation
- Round reset functionality

2. Combat System
- Implement shooting mechanics
- Add different weapon types
- Bullet physics and collision
- Damage system
- Health management
- Death and respawn mechanics

3. Economy System

- Add map-specific features (doors, windows, etc.)
- Optimize map rendering

6. Cosmetic System
- Player skins
- Weapon skins
- Animation effects
- Custom player cards

Technical Implementation Notes:
- Currently using Firebase Realtime Database for real-time updates
- Player positions update at 20Hz to balance responsiveness and network load
- Team-based spawn system with auto-balancing
- Room management includes proper cleanup on both normal exit and disconnection
- Movement system uses delta time for smooth animation
- Collision system checks player corners for accurate wall detection
- Map generation creates varied layouts with minimum room count guarantees

Firebase Security Rules:
- Room creation limited to prevent abuse
- Players can only modify their own data
- Room cleanup handled automatically on host disconnect
- Proper data validation and sanitization

Next Immediate Steps:
1. Implement basic shooting mechanics
2. Add health system
3. Create round system
4. Design buy menu UI
5. Add basic weapon types
6. Implement proper textures
7. Create proper map generation/selection system


ISSUES:
clients joining recieve team NULL
