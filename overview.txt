Game Overview: Rust Strike
Rust Strike is a tactical multiplayer shooting game with team-based gameplay, focusing on objective-based rounds similar to CS:GO. Players can host or join rooms and engage in combat with smooth movement and collision mechanics. Maps are procedurally generated with team spawn points and a central objective area. The game features a clean, minimalist design focused on tactical gameplay rather than complex graphics or sound.

Current Implementation Status:
✓ Basic Multiplayer Setup
- Firebase Realtime Database integration
- Room hosting and joining system
- Player synchronization (20 updates per second)
- Team-based player assignment
- Clean disconnection handling
- Robust error handling for player data synchronization

✓ Basic Movement System
- Smooth, non-grid-based movement
- Proper collision detection
- Position synchronization
- Player aim and direction synchronization

✓ Map System
- Procedural generation
- Team spawn points
- Central objective area
- Wall collision detection
- Safe spawn point detection

✓ Round System (Phase 1) - Core Structure
- Round state management (WAITING, PREP, ACTIVE, END)
- Round timer system
- State transitions
- Player movement restrictions during phases
- Game flow control

✓ Field of View System
- Tile-based raycasting
- Performance-optimized visibility calculations
- Fog of war rendering
- Adaptive ray count based on performance

✓ Combat System
- Weapon system with different gun types
- Bullet mechanics and hit detection
- Damage system and player health synchronization
- Weapon switching and ammo management
- Visual feedback (bullet trails, damage indicators)
- Kill notifications and rewards

Current Features:
1. Weapon System
   - Primary and secondary weapon categories
   - Weapon properties: damage, range, accuracy, fire rate, magazine size
   - Ammo management with reload mechanics
   - Damage falloff based on distance
   - Visual effects for shooting and hits
   - Kills reward players with in-game currency

2. Player Data Synchronization
   - Position, health, and aim direction synced between clients
   - Optimized networking with normalized data structures
   - Robust error handling for disconnects and state changes
   - Health synchronization during combat

3. Combat Mechanics
   - Raycasting for bullet trajectory and hit detection
   - Player hitboxes with accurate collision
   - Client-authoritative damage calculations with server validation
   - Visual feedback for damage taken and dealt

4. Round System
   - Preparation phase with movement restrictions
   - Active combat phase
   - Round end phase with results
   - Automatic transitions between phases

5. Game Flow
   - Team-based spawning
   - Automatic respawn with default equipment at round start
   - Clear visual indications of game state

Next Implementation Plan:

1. Buy Phase Implementation
   - UI overlay during preparation phase
   - Weapon selection and purchasing
   - Equipment persistence between rounds
   - Implementation order:
     a. Create buy menu UI component
     b. Add weapon selection options
     c. Connect with money system
     d. Implement equipment persistence

2. Objective System
   - Bomb mechanics
   - Plant/defuse zones
   - Win conditions
   - Implementation order:
     a. Add bomb item to attacker team
     b. Create plant zones near attacker areas
     c. Implement planting/defusing mechanics
     d. Add bomb timer
     e. Implement win condition checks

3. UI Improvements
   - Scoreboard showing team scores and player stats
   - Kill feed
   - Round timer and state indicators
   - Team indicators and minimap

Technical Implementation Details:
1. Firebase Database Structure:
   - rooms/{roomCode}
     - players/{playerId}: Player data including position, health, equipment
     - round: Round state, timer, and team scores
     - shots: Transient shot data
     - damage: Transient damage events
     - hostPosition: Host player's position (for host presence detection)

2. Player Synchronization:
   - Position updates every 50ms
   - Aim direction updates on significant changes
   - Health updates immediately after damage
   - Equipment updates on weapon changes

3. Normalized Data Structure:
   - Players use normalizeForSync() to create clean data objects
   - Equipment syncing avoids circular references
   - Error handling prevents null reference errors

4. Weapon System:
   - Weapons defined in WeaponCatalog
   - Instance-based weapon objects with state
   - Network-safe reconstruction of weapon data

5. Optimizations:
   - Adaptive raycasting for visibility calculations
   - Minimal network traffic with targeted updates
   - Cleaned up transient data (shots, damage events)
   - Robust error handling for all network operations

Known Issues and Future Improvements:
1. Add proper team balancing
2. Enhance weapon recoil patterns
3. Add proper spectator mode
4. Implement death animations
5. Add sound effects for gameplay actions
6. Create more detailed map decorations
7. Optimize for mobile devices
