Game Overview: Rust Strike
Rust Strike is a simple, top-down multiplayer shooting game. Players can host or join rooms and engage in combat with smooth movement and collision mechanics. Maps are designed using tiles, but player movement is free, creating a fluid and natural feel. The game will implement client-side ray tracing to handle visibility and map rendering to prevent cheating, ensuring only visible areas are shown, and enemies are revealed based on line of sight.

Current Implementation Status:
✓ Basic Multiplayer Setup
- Firebase Realtime Database integration
- Room hosting and joining system
- Proper player synchronization (20 updates per second)
- Safe spawn point system for clients near host
- Clean disconnection handling (both tab close and exit button)

✓ Basic Movement System
- Smooth, non-grid-based movement
- Proper collision detection with walls
- Player position synchronization across clients

✓ Basic Map System
- Tile-based map generation
- Wall collision detection
- Random map generation (currently basic walls)

Next Development Phases:

1. Game Rounds System
- Implement round-based gameplay
- Add round start/end conditions
- Score tracking
- Team assignment system
- Round timer implementation
- Round reset functionality

2. Combat System
- Implement shooting mechanics
- Add different weapon types
- Bullet physics and collision
- Damage system
- Health management
- Death and respawn mechanics

3. Economy System
- Add in-game currency
- Buy menu implementation
- Weapon and equipment purchasing
- Round-based economy rules
- Save/load loadout preferences

4. Visual Improvements
- Add proper textures for walls and floor
- Player character sprites/animations
- Weapon animations
- Particle effects for shooting/hits
- Map visibility system using ray tracing
- UI improvements for game state

5. Map System Enhancement

- Implement map voting system
- Add map-specific features (doors, windows, etc.)
- Optimize map rendering

6. Cosmetic System
- Player skins
- Weapon skins
- Animation effects
- Custom player cards
- Achievement system

7. Sound System

Technical Implementation Notes:
- Currently using Firebase Realtime Database for real-time updates
- Player positions update at 20Hz to balance responsiveness and network load
- Spawn system uses efficient position checking with predefined points
- Room management includes proper cleanup on both normal exit and disconnection
- Movement system uses delta time for smooth animation
- Collision system checks player corners for accurate wall detection

Firebase Security Rules:
- Room creation limited to prevent abuse
- Players can only modify their own data
- Room cleanup handled automatically on host disconnect
- Proper data validation and sanitization

Next Immediate Steps:
1. Implement basic shooting mechanics
2. Add health system
3. Create round system
4. Design buy menu UI
5. Add basic weapon types
6. Implement proper textures
7. Add sound effects
8. Create proper map generation/selection system
